# m1fp‚Äëgo

A like‚ÄëElGamal public‚Äëkey cryptosystem based on the _Modulo‚Äë1 Factoring  
Problem (M1FP)_ with exact additive homomorphism, written in Go.

The implementation is designed to be used on e-voting systems, so the API contains
explicit e-voting references. However it can be used for any other purpose.

## 2  Why is this interesting?

* **Post‚Äëquantum hope** ‚Äì Traditional ElGamal relies on the *Discrete Log* problem, broken in polynomial time by Shor's quantum algorithm.  
  The M1FP problem is *currently* outside the reach of every known quantum algorithm, so the scheme is a candidate for **quantum‚Äëresistant public‚Äëkey encryption**.

* **Exact additive homomorphism** ‚Äì You can add ciphertexts and, after one decryption, obtain the sum of the underlying plaintexts.  
  This is invaluable for **e‚Äëvoting**, private surveys, and any "tally without opening individual ballots" workflow.

* **Perfect precision** ‚Äì This implementation uses a novel **common domain approach** that eliminates precision errors completely, achieving exact arithmetic even for millions of homomorphic additions.

## 3  What is the Modulo‚Äë1 Factoring Problem (M1FP)?

> *Given an irrational real number* `x ‚àà (0,1)`  
> *and another real* `c = (a¬∑x mod 1)` with **unknown integer** `a`,  
> **find `a`.**

* "`mod 1`" keeps only the fractional part, e.g. `0.75 mod 1 = 0.75`,  
  `3.1415 mod 1 = 0.1415`.
* Eric Jarpe (2021) proved M1FP is **NP‚Äëhard**.
* Because `x` is irrational, the fractional sequence `(a¬∑x mod 1)` is
  equidistributed; no efficient lattice attack is known.

## 4  Cryptosystem in a nutshell

| Step | Math (common domain D = 2^P ¬∑ 5^n) | Explanation |
|------|------------------------------------|-------------|
| **KeyGen** | pick secret `a`; compute `h = a¬∑x mod 1`; lift `X,H` to domain `D` | `x` irrational; `D` unifies binary/decimal precision |
| **Encrypt M** | random `r` ‚Üí `(C‚ÇÅ = r¬∑X mod D,  C‚ÇÇ = (M¬∑2^(P-n) + r¬∑H) mod D)` | All arithmetic in single domain `D` |
| **Decrypt** | compute `M' = (C‚ÇÇ - a¬∑C‚ÇÅ) mod D`, then `M = M'/2^(P-n)` | Exact recovery with proper rounding |

`P = 256` bits precision, `n = 9` decimal digits for voting. The common domain `D = 2^P ¬∑ 5^n` eliminates precision loss.

## 5  Precision Solution: Common Domain Approach

Previous implementations suffered from **precision drift** when converting between binary (`mod 2^P`) and decimal (`mod 10^n`) domains. Floor operations like `‚åäR √ó 10^n / 2^P‚åã` introduced tiny errors that accumulated over thousands of homomorphic additions, causing vote counting errors of 5-10 votes in 100k tallies.

### Unified Arithmetic Domain

We implement all encryption arithmetic in a **single high-precision domain** `D = 2^P ¬∑ 5^n`:

1. **Mathematical Foundation**  
   Since `10^n = 2^n ¬∑ 5^n`, we have:
   ```
   D = 2^P ¬∑ 5^n = 2^P ¬∑ (10^n / 2^n) = (2^(P-n)) ¬∑ 10^n
   ```
   This makes `D` divisible by both `2^P` and `10^n`, allowing exact conversions.

2. **Message Encoding**  
   Messages are lifted to the common domain:
   ```
   M_encoded = message √ó (D / 10^n) = message √ó 2^(P-n)
   ```

3. **Encryption in Common Domain**  
   ```
   C‚ÇÅ = (r ¬∑ X) mod D
   C‚ÇÇ = (M_encoded + r ¬∑ H) mod D
   ```
   Where `X` and `H` are also lifted to domain `D`.

4. **Exact Decryption**  
   ```
   M' = (C‚ÇÇ - a¬∑C‚ÇÅ) mod D
   message = M' / 2^(P-n)  [with proper rounding]
   ```

### Benefits

* **Zero precision loss** ‚Äì No floor operations during encryption/addition
* **Exact arithmetic** ‚Äì All operations are integer arithmetic mod D
* **Perfect scaling** ‚Äì Handles millions of additions without drift
* **Simpler code** ‚Äì No complex carry bit logic needed

## 6  How additive homomorphism works üî¢

The homomorphic property works because addition in the common domain preserves the linear structure:

```
Enc(m‚ÇÅ) + Enc(m‚ÇÇ) = Enc(m‚ÇÅ + m‚ÇÇ)
```

Given two ciphertexts **E(M‚ÇÅ) = (C‚ÇÅ, C‚ÇÇ)** and **E(M‚ÇÇ) = (C‚ÇÅ‚Ä≤, C‚ÇÇ‚Ä≤)**:

1. **Simple Addition in Common Domain**  
   ```
   C‚ÇÅ_sum = (C‚ÇÅ + C‚ÇÅ‚Ä≤) mod D
   C‚ÇÇ_sum = (C‚ÇÇ + C‚ÇÇ‚Ä≤) mod D
   ```
   
2. **Why This Works**  
   ```
   C‚ÇÇ_sum = (M‚ÇÅ¬∑2^(P-n) + r‚ÇÅ¬∑H + M‚ÇÇ¬∑2^(P-n) + r‚ÇÇ¬∑H) mod D
          = ((M‚ÇÅ + M‚ÇÇ)¬∑2^(P-n) + (r‚ÇÅ + r‚ÇÇ)¬∑H) mod D
   ```
   
   This is exactly the encryption of `(M‚ÇÅ + M‚ÇÇ)` with randomness `(r‚ÇÅ + r‚ÇÇ)`.

3. **Decryption of Sum**  
   ```
   M'_sum = (C‚ÇÇ_sum - a¬∑C‚ÇÅ_sum) mod D
          = (M‚ÇÅ + M‚ÇÇ)¬∑2^(P-n) mod D
   
   sum = M'_sum / 2^(P-n)  [exact division with rounding]
   ```

### Example: Adding Two Votes

```
Vote 1: 42    ‚Üí  M‚ÇÅ = 42 √ó 2^(256-9) = 42 √ó 2^247
Vote 2: 17    ‚Üí  M‚ÇÇ = 17 √ó 2^247

After encryption:
C‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ = (r‚ÇÅ √ó X) mod D,  C‚ÇÇ‚ÇÅ = (M‚ÇÅ + r‚ÇÅ √ó H) mod D
C‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇ = (r‚ÇÇ √ó X) mod D,  C‚ÇÇ‚ÇÇ = (M‚ÇÇ + r‚ÇÇ √ó H) mod D

Homomorphic addition:
C‚ÇÅ_sum = (C‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ + C‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇ) mod D
C‚ÇÇ_sum = (C‚ÇÇ‚ÇÅ + C‚ÇÇ‚ÇÇ) mod D

Decryption:
M'_sum = (C‚ÇÇ_sum - a √ó C‚ÇÅ_sum) mod D
       = (42 + 17) √ó 2^247 mod D
       = 59 √ó 2^247 mod D

Final result: 59 √ó 2^247 / 2^247 = 59  ‚úì
```

### Security Properties

* **Semantic security** ‚Äì Each ciphertext component looks uniformly random
* **Homomorphic privacy** ‚Äì Individual votes remain hidden, only the sum is revealed
* **Perfect correctness** ‚Äì Zero precision errors even with millions of additions
* **Efficient verification** ‚Äì Results can be independently verified

## 7  Design & engineering choices

| Decision | Motivation for e‚Äëvoting |
|----------|------------------------|
| **Common domain D = 2^256 ¬∑ 5^9** | Eliminates precision loss; supports 100M+ votes with perfect accuracy |
| **Fixed precision** (`P=256 bits, n=9 digits`) | Plenty of headroom; `2^256` >> `10^9` ensures exact arithmetic |
| **ASCII‚Äëto‚Äëdecimal (3 digits/byte)** | Human‚Äëreadable test vectors, easy range proofs |
| **Unified modular arithmetic** | Simpler code, no carry propagation needed |
| **Exact division with rounding** | Handles any remainder correctly in final conversion |
| **Binary key format** | Compact storage comparable to RSA keys |

## 8  Limitations & open points

* **Novel assumption** ‚Äì M1FP is much less studied than lattices or codes.  
  Treat this as experimental **until peer‚Äëreview hardens the security**.
* **Chosen‚Äëciphertext security** ‚Äì base scheme is IND‚ÄëCPA.  
  Use a KEM+AEAD wrapper or apply Cramer‚ÄìShoup style techniques for IND‚ÄëCCA2.
* **Decimal encoding overhead** ‚Äì 3√ó blow‚Äëup.  A custom base‚Äë2¬π‚Å∂ packing
  would be denser.
* **No signature / key‚Äëexchange yet** ‚Äì only encryption; signatures could
  reuse the same trapdoor but are future work.

---

## 9  Why is the additive scheme safe?

* Each ciphertext reveals only `(C‚ÇÅ, C‚ÇÇ)` which look uniformly random
  because `r` is fresh and the M1FP assumption makes `r¬∑H` unpredictable.
* Adding ciphertexts preserves the distribution: the sum has the same
  statistical properties as an honest encryption of the numeric sum.
* **Perfect linearity** ‚Äì The common domain approach ensures that
  `Enc(m‚ÇÅ) + Enc(m‚ÇÇ) = Enc(m‚ÇÅ + m‚ÇÇ)` holds exactly, with no approximation errors.
* No extra information is leaked; adversaries cannot learn individual
  ballots, only the final tally once the holder of `a` decrypts.

}
```

### Voting-specific API

```go
// Encrypt a numeric vote (0-64)
ct, _, _ := m1fp.EncryptVote(pk, 42, nil)

// Add votes homomorphically  
tally, _ := ct1.Add(ct2, pk.Prec)

// Decrypt final count
result, _ := m1fp.DecryptVote(sk, tally)
fmt.Println("Total votes:", result) // Exact count
```

### Binary key export / import

```go
blob, _ := pk.MarshalBinary()
var pk2 m1fp.PublicKey
pk2.UnmarshalBinary(blob)
// pk2 is now identical to pk
```

### Deterministic encryption (for tests)

```go
r := big.NewInt(1234567)
ct, _ := m1fp.EncryptDeterministic(pk, "Hello", r)
```
